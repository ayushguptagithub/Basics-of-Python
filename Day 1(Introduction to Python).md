print("Hello, World!")
```


---

### 1. **Basic Print**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### 2. **Printing Variables**
```python
name = "Ayush"
print(name)
```

---

### 3. **Printing Multiple Items**
- **Using commas (adds spaces by default):**
```python
name = "Ayush"
age = 25
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

---

### 4. **String Concatenation**
```python
name = "Ayush"
print("Hello, " + name)
```

---

### 5. **String Formatting**
- **Using `%` (Old-style formatting):**
```python
name = "Ayush"
age = 25
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```

- **Using `.format()` (Modern-style formatting):**
```python
name = "Ayush"
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
```

- **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
```python
name = "Ayush"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

---

### 6. **Using Escape Characters**
```python
print("Hello\nWorld")  # New line
print("Hello\tWorld")  # Tab
print("He said, \"Python is awesome!\"")  # Double quotes inside a string
```

---

### 7. **Specifying a Separator**
- **Default separator is a space, but it can be changed using `sep`:**
```python
print("Python", "is", "fun", sep="-")
```

---

### 8. **Custom End Character**
- **Default `end` is a newline, but it can be changed:**
```python
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")
```

---

### 9. **Printing to a File**
```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    print("Hello, File!", file=file)
```

---

### 10. **Printing Non-String Data**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers)
```

---

### 11. **Printing Unicode Characters**
```python
print("\u2764")  # Prints a heart emoji (‚ù§)
```

---

### 12. **Using Print with Debugging Tools**
```python
print(f"Debugging: Variable value is {variable}")
```
Python provides a wide range of data types to handle different kinds of data. These data types can be broadly categorized into built-in data types and derived data types. Here's a comprehensive list:

---

### **1. Numeric Types**
Used to represent numbers.

- **int**: Integer values (e.g., -5, 0, 100).
  ```python
  x = 10  # int
  ```

- **float**: Decimal or floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.7).
  ```python
  y = 3.14  # float
  ```

- **complex**: Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 3+5j).
  ```python
  z = 3 + 5j  # complex
  ```

---

### **2. Sequence Types**
Used to store collections of items in a specific order.

- **str**: Strings (immutable sequences of characters).
  ```python
  name = "Python"  # str
  ```

- **list**: Ordered, mutable collection of elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # list
  ```

- **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection of elements (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple
  ```

---

### **3. Mapping Type**
Used to store key-value pairs.

- **dict**: Dictionary, an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Ayush", "age": 25}  # dict
  ```

---

### **4. Set Types**
Used to store unordered collections of unique items.

- **set**: Mutable, unordered collection of unique elements.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3}  # set
  ```

- **frozenset**: Immutable version of a set.
  ```python
  my_frozenset = frozenset({1, 2, 3})  # frozenset
  ```

---

### **5. Boolean Type**
Represents truth values.

- **bool**: True or False.
  ```python
  is_active = True  # bool
  ```




### **Type Checking**
You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function:
```python
x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### **Introduction to Conditional Statements in Python**

Conditional statements allow your program to execute a specific block of code based on a condition. These statements use boolean expressions (`True` or `False`) to determine which path the program should take.

---

### **Types of Conditional Statements**

#### 1. **if Statement**
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
```

**Example:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
```

---

#### 2. **if-else Statement**
The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is `False`.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False
```

**Example:**
```python
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

---

#### 3. **if-elif-else Statement**
The `if-elif-else` structure is used to check multiple conditions in sequence. Only the first condition that evaluates to `True` will be executed.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

**Example:**
```python
marks = 75

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

---

#### 4. **Nested if Statements**
An `if` statement can be nested inside another `if` statement for more complex conditions.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Code to execute if both conditions are True
```

**Example:**
```python
num = 10

if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("The number is positive and even.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive and odd.")
else:
    print("The number is not positive.")
```

---

#### 5. **Short-Hand if**
For simple conditions, you can write the `if` statement in a single line.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition: action
```

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
if x > 0: print("x is positive")
```

---

#### 6. **Short-Hand if-else (Ternary Operator)**
A concise way to write `if-else` statements.

**Syntax:**
```python
action_if_true if condition else action_if_false
```

**Example:**
```python
x = 10
result = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)
```

---

### **Logical Operators in Conditional Statements**
Logical operators can be used to combine multiple conditions:
- **and**: Both conditions must be true.
- **or**: At least one condition must be true.
- **not**: Negates the condition.

**Example:**
```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("Access granted.")
else:
    print("Access denied.")
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. Indentation is crucial in Python. Blocks of code inside conditions must be indented.
2. You can nest multiple `if` statements for complex logic.
3. Use logical operators for combining multiple conditions.

### **Introduction to Loops in Python**

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for tasks that require repetitive actions, such as iterating through items in a list or performing calculations multiple times.

---

### **Types of Loops in Python**

#### 1. **`for` Loop**
The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

**Syntax:**
```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item
```

**Example:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

#### 2. **`while` Loop**
The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True
```

**Example:**
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

### **Control Statements in Loops**

Python provides control statements to alter the flow of a loop:

#### **1. `break` Statement**
The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a specific condition is met.

**Example:**
```python
for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
```

---

#### **2. `continue` Statement**
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

**Example:**
```python
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
```

---

#### **3. `pass` Statement**
The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing. It‚Äôs useful for creating loops that are meant to be completed later.

**Example:**
```python
for num in range(1, 4):
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
```

---

### **Looping Techniques**

#### **1. Using `range()` in Loops**
The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):  # Numbers from 1 to 5
    print(i)
```

#### **2. Nested Loops**
A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

---

### **Loop with `else`**
The `else` block is executed when the loop finishes without a `break`.

**Example:**
```python
for num in range(1, 4):
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop finished!")
```

---

### **Iterating Over Different Data Types**

#### **1. List**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

#### **2. String**
```python
my_string = "Python"
for char in my_string:
    print(char)
```

#### **3. Dictionary**
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Ayush", "age": 25}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. Use `for` loops for sequences and `while` loops for conditions.
2. Use `break` to exit the loop and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.
3. Nested loops can be used for multi-dimensional data.
4. The `else` clause in loops adds more control after loop completion.
